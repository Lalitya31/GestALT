                <p class="idea-text">
                    Most UI/UX education begins with documentation. You read about visual hierarchy, 
                    whitespace, contrast, and accessibility before ever touching an interface. But 
                    <strong>UI/UX is not a subject you read about—it's something you perceive</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    When you look at an interface, your brain doesn't think in principles. It flows 
                    along pathways of size, color, and spacing. It builds a mental model before conscious 
                    thought. Learning through text reverses this natural sequence. GestALT restores it.

                    "You don't learn to see by reading about vision. You learn by looking, adjusting, 
                    and noticing what changed."

                <h2 class="idea-heading">Perception as a Simulation, Not Opinion</h2>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    At the heart of GestALT is a perception simulation engine. This isn't subjective 
                    critique—it's a deterministic model of how visual properties influence attention.
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    Every UI element you create has measurable properties: size, contrast, position, 
                    spacing, semantic role. The engine calculates:
                </p>
                <ul class="idea-list">
                    <li><strong>First-attention probability</strong> — Where the eye lands first</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual hierarchy score</strong> — How clearly importance is communicated</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive load</strong> — Mental effort required to process the interface</li>
                    <li><strong>Error likelihood</strong> — Chance of user confusion or mistakes</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    This transforms feedback from <em>"that doesn't look good"</em> into 
                    <em>"here's why attention fragmented and how to fix it."</em>
                </p>

                <h2 class="idea-heading">Decisions Before Principles</h2>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    Traditional education says: <em>"Learn the rule, then apply it."</em><br>
                    GestALT says: <em>"Make the decision, then understand the consequence."</em>
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    You're presented with a flawed interface. No instructions. No lectures. Just: 
                    <strong>fix this</strong>. You adjust spacing, resize elements, change contrast. 
                    Only then does the system explain what happened and why it mattered.
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    This mirrors how real designers work. You don't design by reciting principles—you 
                    prototype, observe, iterate. GestALT compresses this loop into seconds.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="idea-block">
                <h2 class="idea-heading">Learning That Adapts to You</h2>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    GestALT doesn't treat everyone the same. It builds a skill model for each learner by tracking:
                </p>
                <ul class="idea-list">
                    <li>Which design principles you violate repeatedly</li>
                    <li>How long you take to recognize hierarchy issues</li>
                    <li>Whether you rely on hints or explore independently</li>
                    <li>Where you excel and where you struggle</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    Based on your profile, future challenges adapt. Strong on visual hierarchy? The system 
                    increases difficulty. Weak on accessibility? It reinforces those constraints. This isn't 
                    gamification—it's <strong>personalized cognitive scaffolding</strong>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="idea-block">
                <h2 class="idea-heading">Accessibility as Constraint, Not Checklist</h2>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    Most platforms treat accessibility as an afterthought—a list of rules to check at the end. 
                    GestALT treats it as a <strong>first-class constraint engine</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    Every design you create is validated in real-time for:
                </p>
                <ul class="idea-list">
                    <li>WCAG color contrast ratios (AA/AAA compliance)</li>
                    <li>Minimum touch target sizes (44×44px)</li>
                    <li>Keyboard navigation flow and focus visibility</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    In advanced challenges, you face real-world tradeoffs: achieving aesthetic goals while 
                    satisfying accessibility requirements. This reflects what engineers and designers actually 
                    face in production systems.

                <h2 class="idea-heading">Explainability as a Core Value</h2>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    For every evaluation, GestALT shows its reasoning. When your design scores poorly, you see:
                </p>
                <ul class="idea-list">
                    <li>Which visual principles were violated</li>
                    <li>Which specific rules triggered penalties</li>
                    <li>How small changes altered perception metrics</li>
                    <li>A visual heatmap of attention flow</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    This transparency is intentional. Learning isn't just about getting the right answer—it's 
                    about understanding <em>why</em> it's right. The system doesn't hide its logic; it teaches 
                    through it.

                <h2 class="idea-heading">Design as System, Not Aesthetic</h2>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    GestALT doesn't teach design as taste or style. It teaches it as a <strong>decision 
                    system with measurable outcomes</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    Every choice you make—font size, spacing, color, alignment—propagates through the 
                    perception model. The system calculates consequences, not judgments. This reframes 
                    design from subjective art to <em>engineered experience</em>.

                <p class="idea-text">
                    From a software engineering perspective, this required explicit domain modeling:

                <p class="idea-text">

                <h2 class="idea-heading">Why Typography and Color Matter Here</h2>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    GestALT uses <strong>Merienda</strong> for headings and <strong>Work Sans</strong> for body text. 
                    This isn't arbitrary.
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    Merienda has warmth—it signals that learning is human, inviting, perceptual. Work Sans is 
                    neutral and invisible—it keeps cognition focused on problem-solving. <strong>JetBrains Mono</strong> 
                    appears in metrics and debug overlays, reinforcing the engineering nature of the system.

                <p class="idea-text">
                    The color palette follows the <em>Calm Perceptual Focus</em> system:

                    These choices reduce cognitive load, encourage sustained attention, and make users feel

                <h2 class="idea-heading">An Alternative, Not a Replacement</h2>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    GestALT doesn't claim that theory is useless or that traditional education is broken. 
                    It offers an <strong>alternative path</strong> for those who learn better through 
                    perception and interaction.

                <p class="idea-text">
                    Some people thrive on reading documentation. Others need to see, touch, and break things. 
                    GestALT is for the latter—those who understand design not by memorizing rules but by 
                    <em>feeling the consequences of their decisions</em>.

                <p class="idea-text">
                    Every decision in this project—from the perception engine to the typography—was made with 
                    intentionality. GestALT is not just a portfolio piece. It's a statement about how systems 
                    can be built to respect how humans actually learn.

                <p class="idea-text">
                    It's a fusion of design sensitivity and engineering rigor. It's an argument that learning 
                    platforms should model cognition, not just deliver content. It's proof that software can be 
                    both <strong>technically sophisticated and deeply human</strong>.
